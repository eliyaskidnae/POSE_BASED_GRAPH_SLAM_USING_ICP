## Introduction
this project research focuses on the implementation  of an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) SLAM algorithm using the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) method
for scan matching. The primary objective is to investigate
the effectiveness of the proposed EKF SLAM algorithm
in both simulated and real-world environments and to
address the main challenges associated with its application.
By leveraging the ICP method, the algorithm aims to refine
pose estimates through accurate scan matching, thereby
enhancing the overall SLAM performance.
The algorithm is implemented on a Kobuki Turtlebot, a
widely-used mobile robot platform known for its robustness
and versatility. The Turtlebot is equipped with a 2D LIDAR,
IMU, and wheel encoders, which provide the necessary
sensor data for SLAM. The integration of these sensors
enables the robot to perform real-time mapping and
localization with improved accuracy.
