## Introduction
This project research focuses on the implementation  of an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) SLAM algorithm using the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) method
for scan matching. The primary objective is to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed EKF SLAM algorithm in both simulated and real-world environments and to address the main challenges associated with its application. By leveraging the ICP method, the algorithm aims to refine pose estimates through accurate scan matching, thereby enhancing the overall SLAM performance.The algorithm is implemented on a Kobuki Turtlebot, a widely-used mobile robot platform known for its robustness and versatility. The Turtlebot is equipped with a 2D LIDAR, IMU, and wheel encoders, which provide the necessary sensor data for SLAM. The integration of these sensors enables the robot to perform real-time mapping and localization with improved accuracy.
